# To contribute

**If you are working on an existing issue, please claim it with your comment, so there is no duplicate work.**

## What you will need before you begin:

1. Ensure NodeJS version 12.16.3 LTS or larger is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm install` in the folder that you've just cloned to ensure you have all dependencies that are needed for development.

## Steps to follow when your work is ready:

When your work is done:
1. Run `npm run build`.
2. After a successful build, make a commit and push your changes. If you're fixing a existing issue: be sure to link to that issue in the git commit message, like so: `Closes #issueNumberThatGetsFixed`.
3. Create a new Pull Request.
4. Write a good description of the changes this pull-request will make.
5. You must provide screenshots if there is a visual change.
